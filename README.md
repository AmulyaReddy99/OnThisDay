# Mnemosyne: The Goddess Of Memory
Spreading nostalgia since... no one knows!

## OnThisDay

The application goes through all the messages sent previously in the organisation on the same day
 (in the last 6 years or last 6 months) and revives the message with the highest number of reactions,
 and sends it to the 'random' channel.

## Using The App
The client is currently under development and hence using it is a little difficult on workspaces where the creator
is not a member. The client will soon be available on the slack web store.

## Permission required
The following slack API scopes are used by _Mnemosyne_:

```
- channels:history
- channels:read
- chat:write:bot
- search:read
```

## Contributions
Contributions to the project are welcome, and if you have any ideas or issues you face, please raise a ticket.

Please read CONTRIBUTING.md guide to know more.
